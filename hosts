# This file is intentionally empty.
# 
# Environment-specific hosts files should be used instead:
# - hosts-development
# - hosts-staging  
# - hosts-production
#
# The run_playbooks.sh script will automatically use the appropriate
# environment-specific hosts file based on the current environment setting.
# This file serves as a fallback only if the environment-specific file is missing.
#
# To add hosts for a specific environment, create the corresponding file:
# Example: hosts-production, hosts-staging, or hosts-development
