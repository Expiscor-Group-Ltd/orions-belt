# How to Contribute to Orion's Belt

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Orion's Belt! We are excited to build a strong community around this project.

### Core Architectural Phase

Orion's Belt is currently in a deep, foundational development phase. The core team is focused on solving the primary architectural challenges required to make this project robust and scalable.

Because of this, **we are not accepting code contributions or pull requests for new features at this time.** This allows us to maintain a focused and systematic development process as we build out the core framework.

### How You Can Help Right Now

While we are not taking code contributions, your feedback and ideas are invaluable! Here is how you can help during this phase:

1.  **Open an Issue for Discussion:** If you have an idea, a suggestion for a feature, or want to discuss a specific hardening control, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Expiscor-Group-Ltd/orions-belt/issues). This is the best way to share your thoughts with the team.

2.  **Provide Feedback:** As we release pre-alpha and alpha versions, we will be looking for users to test them and provide detailed feedback on their experiences.

3.  **"Watch" the Repository:** Click the "Watch" button on GitHub to be notified of major updates and announcements, including when we are ready to accept broader community contributions.

We look forward to collaborating more openly once the foundational framework is in place. Thank you for your understanding and support!
