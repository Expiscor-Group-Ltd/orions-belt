# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# Explanation of pam_unix options:
# The "yescrypt" option enables
#hashed passwords using the yescrypt algorithm, introduced in Debian
#11.  Without this option, the default is Unix crypt.  Prior releases
#used the option "sha512"; if a shadow password hash will be shared
#between Debian 11 and older releases replace "yescrypt" with "sha512"
#for compatibility .  The "obscure" option replaces the old
#`OBSCURE_CHECKS_ENAB' option in login.defs.  See the pam_unix manpage
#for other options.

# As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.
# To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any
# local modules either before or after the default block, and use
# pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See
# pam-auth-update(8) for details.

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
# Password quality enforcement
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3
password        sufficient                      pam_unix.so obscure yescrypt
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
# end of pam-auth-update config
